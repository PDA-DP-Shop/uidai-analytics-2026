1. ILLEGAL CONTENT (NO)
   - Status: PROVED compliant.

2. MALICIOUS CODE (NO)
   - Status: PROVED compliant.

3. DISCRIMINATORY LOGIC (NO)
   - Status: PROVED compliant.
   - Evidence: The Machine Learning model (Isolation Forest) and simulation logic operate on statistical distributions. There is no hardcoded bias, weighting, or logic that discriminates against any gender, religion, caste, or region.

4. MISLEADING REPRESENTATIONS (NO)
   - Status: PROVED compliant (with mitigations).
   - Evidence: To prevent confusion with official government systems, a clear Disclaimer has been added to the `README.md` and the website footer explicitly stating: "This is a hackathon prototype using synthetic data. NOT connected to real Aadhaar database."
